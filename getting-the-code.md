#Getting the Code

##TL;DR version

Fork the repository. Clone your fork using your favorite Git client tool

##Long version:

We use the Github Flow process on all our projects (link). That means you are not commiting your 
changes directly to our repositories. Instead, you will submit a Pull Request for one of the 
lead committers to pull your changes into our repository. That enables us to review your 
changes, and discuss them with you. We even use this process ourselves: other core team members
review our changes and pull them into the repository.

The first step in this process is to get the code onto your machine, configured with a 
github repository where you can commit your changes. You do that by creating a fork of
the project repository in your account. You (and only you) have write access to your fork.

Now, you can clone your fork onto your desktop. You'll commit your changes locally, and 
then push them to your fork on github.
