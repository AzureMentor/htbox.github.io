#Responding to Reviews

##TL;DR;

If you update your code, and push to your fork, github automatically updates the PR. We'll see the
changes. If you disagree with the review, please comment on the code, and tell us why your 
approach is better. We may or may not approve it, but we will listen.

##Long Version

Reviews are especially important when you are making your first PR for us. It's a way to have
a conversation about the code as you make it. We appreciate the volunteer contributions we receive, and 
we value your time. We'd rather help comment early then reject work.

We review PRs (even WIP PRs) once a day, and we will give actionable feedback. Please respond in the 
same tone we use. We want great projects, and we respect your time and contribution. The people reviewing
code are also volunteers and expect to receive the same respect.
