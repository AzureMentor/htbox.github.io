    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
All of our projects are Open Source, and released under the MIT license. Before you do anything,
ensure that working on our projects does not conflict with any of your employee agreements. 
</p>
<p>
We manage project workflow using a form of 'volunteer scrum' process. It's essentially scrum,
but because we know everyone is a volunteer, we expect large flucuations in velocity. We
also know that our volunteers have other committments, and may need to pull away from an
assigned task before it's completed.
</p>
<p>

The remainder of this document explains how our projects are organized, how to assign 
yourself work, and how to sumbit that work for review. We'll also explain how to submit ideas
for work that you want to do to enhance our projects.
