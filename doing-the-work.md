#Doing the work

##TL;DR version

Work as you normally would, commit and push your changes at the cadence that works for you.
Please make one Pull Request for one Issue, rather than fixing several issues in on PR. It's much 
easier for us to review and merge when a PR is focused on one issue.

##Long Version:

There are a few steps here that can help us review your pull request and ensure a smooth process 
when we take your code. All the tips described here make it easier for us to merge your changes
with changes being made by other developers.

On at least a daily basis, rebase the changes you are making on the master branch <link>. This 
ensures that when you have completed your work, it merges easily into the master branch.

We recommending rebasing instead of merging the master branch into your fork because thaA creates a 
cleaner pull request.

Consider squash commits. A squash commit combines several original commit actions into one commit.
The result is a single commit that shows all your changes. This isn't necessary, but if you are 
comfortable doing it, please do.
